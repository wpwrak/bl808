Experimental overrides for SDH
==============================

Some people experienced problems when trying to use uSD cards on the Ox64 or
the M1s.


Analysis
--------

We found that CMD on the SD bus changed at the rising edge of CLK, not at the
falling edge. This is shown in the screenshot cmd-clk.png in this directory.
We tentatively call this phenomenon a "clock inversion", but it could also be
caused by a phase shift.

We found that this behaviour occurs if the clock divider from the SDH (SD host
controller) clock to the SD bus clock is set to a ratio different from 1:1
(register value 0.)

The SD bus clock can still be controlled by changing the SDH clock, which is
derived from a 96 MHz clock:

96 MHz ---(SDH_CLK_DIV)---> SDH ---(SDHCI_DIV)---> SD bus

Unfortunately, some people who had not experienced SD card issues before ran
into problems when we changed the SD bus divider to 1:1. In order to make the
clock setup more flexible, this set of changes implements overrides that can be
selected from the U-Boot command line, and thus allow trying different clock
configurations in a single session.


Setup
-----

We assume that the buildroot repo has been cloned into a subdirectory of bl808,
named buildroot/

Furthermore, we assume that buildroot_bouffalo has been cloned, too, and that
a complete build run has been made. I.e., the sources of U-Boot and the Linux
kernel are now in buildroot/output/build/

See ../NOTES-buildroot.txt in this repository for details on how to clone and
build buildroot.


Patch U-Boot
------------

We start from the bl808 top-level directory.

cd buildroot
patch -p0 -d output/build/uboot-bl808-2023-02-19 <../sdh/uboot-bflb-sdhci.diff
make uboot-rebuild
make

This will generate a buildroot/output/images/bl808-firmware.bin with the
changed U-Boot. You can now flash and boot it.


Patch Linux
-----------

We start from the bl808 top-level directory.

cd buildroot
patch -p0 -d output/build/linux-6.2 <../sdh/linux-sdhci-bflb.diff
make linux-rebuild
make

This will generate a buildroot/output/images/Image with the changed Linux
kernel. You can now copy it to the top-level directory of the boot partition
on the uSD card.


Patch buildroot_bouffalo
------------------------

We start from the bl808 top-level directory.

cd buildroot_bouffalo
patch -p1 <../sdh/buildroot-extlinux.diff
make -C ../buildroot

This should produce a buildroot/output/images/sdcard.img with the variable
${bootargs} added to the kernel boot command line options, allowing us to pass
overrides to the kernel.

You can also edit /extlinux/extlinux.conf on the boot partition of the uSD card
directly.


Undoing the changes
-------------------

The following commands remove the checked-out sources from buildroot/output/,
along with the above changes:

cd buildroot
make uboot-dirclean
make linux-dirclean

To revert the change in buildroot_bouffalo,

cd buildroot_bouffalo
git stash


Reproducing the original problem
--------------------------------

On systems that are affected by the clock inversion, if booting without
activating any overrides, the boot process fails in U-Boot with:

[...]
Loading Environment from FAT... sdhci_send_command: Timeout for status update!
sdhci_send_command: Timeout for status update!
Card did not respond to voltage select! : -110
[...]

In this case, U-Boot will try for a while to boot from BOOTP, but eventually it
will stop at the command-line prompt.

The error can also be reproduced with "mmc rescan", which is much faster than a
boot attempt.


Clock overrides in U-Boot
-------------------------

At the U-Boot command line enter:

bflb_sdh sdh 8
bflb_sdh bus 1

This sets the SDH clock divider to 1:8, producing a 12 MHz clock for the SDH.
The bus clock divider is set to 1:1, resulting in a bus clock of 12 MHz as
well.

Each time U-Boot is applying overrides (this typically happens several times
per card detection), it prints how the register value has changed, e.g.,

SDH_CFG0: 0x00002000 -> 0x00002e00
SDHCI_CLOCK_CONTROL: 0x0000 -> 0x0000

"mmc rescan" should now succeed, and "boot" should load and start the Linux
kernel. However, the kernel will also run into the same problem, and thus fail
to mount the root filesystem.


Clock override in Linux
-----------------------

While still at the U-Boot command line, enter:

setenv bootargs ${bootargs} sdhci-bflb.bus_div=1
boot

This instructs the kernel to use a bus clock divider of 1:1 as well. The kernel
does not change the SDH clock set by U-Boot, so there is no override for this.

Each time the kernel is applying overrides (this happens several times per card
detection), it prints how the register value has changed, e.g.,

[    0.433624] sdhci-bflb 20060000.sdhci: SDHCI_CLOCK_CONTROL: 0x0000 -> 0x0000

The kernel should now boot normally, and mount the root file system from the
uSD card.
