BL808 Bare-Metal Code
=====================

Code that runs on the bare metal, i.e., without relying on drivers or hardware
access libraries.

We define three levels of bare-metallicity:

- lead: code runs under Linux. The kernel will have set up an execution
  environment and many registers will be initialized to some sane values. This
  is mainly to debug the functionality of code that will then be used at the
  lower level.

- copper: code is launched by loadlow, i.e., it takes the role of U-Boot. This
  differs from "lead" mainly in having to set up our own execution environment,
  and maybe some more registers.

- steel: code replaces loadlow. Registers will be at their reset values.
