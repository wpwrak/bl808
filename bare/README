BL808 Bare-Metal Code
=====================

Code that runs on the bare metal, i.e., without relying on drivers or hardware
access libraries.

We define three levels of bare-metallicity:

- lead: code runs under Linux. The kernel will have set up an execution
  environment and many registers will be initialized to some sane values. This
  is mainly to debug the functionality of code that will then be used at the
  lower level.

- copper: code is launched by lowload or the SDK, i.e., we omit U-Boot and
  Linux. This differs from "lead" mainly in having to set up our own execution
  environment, and maybe some more registers.

- steel: code is run directly by the ROM, replacing lowload and such. Registers
  will be at their reset values.


Status
------

None of the drivers in this proof-of-concept implementation use interrupts or
DMA. They also don't implement functionality we don't expect to need for the
proof of concept. All this is at the "lead" level.

Peripheral	Where	Status
----------	-----	-------------------------------------------------------
GPIO		BL808	supports all relevant features
  LED		M1s	works in "lead"
SPI0		BL808	Tx-only, SPI-GPIO synchronization via delays
  ST7789V	M1s	basic setup
I2C0		BL808	read and write, see i2c.c for known issues
  CST816	M1s	default settings (single finger, tap and slide)
  BMA400	Sunela	produces samples
  ATECC608B	Sunela	can request and obtain the chip ID

BMA400 and ATECC608B are local additions.
